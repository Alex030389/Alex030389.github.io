          separate domain name and run his own web site on internet in low cost through this facility.</p>
        <p>If you have plans to take free hosting you must also keep in mind that there are certain restrictions and
          inconveniences that you may have to bear with this free service. Most of these free hosting services do not
          permit their clients to have separate domain name, so there are great chances that one has to act as a
          subsidiary of some main domain name of that site which is providing cheap low cost web hosting. Also the pop
          ups and banners displaying the name of web service provider will continuously appear on the pages of your web
          site. That can be quite annoying for your viewer of website. Your ultimate solution to get rid of all these

          choosing the service provider in cheap rates. Before you make your final decision about taking the services
          from these low cost website hosting you must read their packages carefully and consider the practical aspects
          of their implementation in long run. It is always advisable to stay away from the offers which look too good
          to be true or just look out of this world with too much low cost.</p>
        <p>It is not too difficult to find a good and reliable service provider who can offer affordable low cost web
          hosting on internet, but you must have some idea about the technical aspects of the business before you sign
          up a deal with any service provider. Try to do some home work about your needs before you sign up for any low
          cost web host. You must figure out how much space you will require, how much bandwidth you will need etc. Even
          if you can’t have the exact idea have some rough estimate of all these issues, it can be of great help in your
          deal for web hosting services.</p>
        <p>Before you make a final decision about any service provider check out the reviews about that service provider
          given by its former or current clients. That can be of great help to choose the right kind of web hosting
          service for your web site. To check the quality of their services, try to find out how they tackle the
          problems of their customers related to technicalities of websites. It is also highly advisable to go for the
          settled group of low cost web hosting service instead of experimenting with some new people in the
          business.</p>
        <p>As website has to run on internet 24 hours a day and 12 months a year so the dependency and reliability on
          your web host is of great importance. The uptime which is standard in the industry right now is 99.9%. If you
          settle down for something below than this rate with your low cost host then you will not be bale to compete in
          the market. If you choose some low cost reliable web hosting then they can provide you up to 250 GB of
          bandwidth which is considered as good one in the market. These companies provide more than a single carrier
          line. The cost you have to bear for 250 GB band width with low cost web hosting can be as low as $5.95 per
          month. With good band width you can make sure that your website is running on internet without any problems
          24/7.</p>
        <p>For small business hosting company the space offered in the package might be less then needed, but you can
          have extra storage capacity by paying some extra charges. Many low cost domain hosting firms are also offering
          space up to 1000 MB in less than $10 per month. The storage space is of great importance for any web hosting
          company so it is their top priority to provide maximum space to their customers. So, low cost web hosting

          terms of low cost email hosting as many firms provide up to 100 email accounts to their clients of hosting in
          general. Some firms are also offering the facility of E-Commerce to their clients of web hosting.</p>
        <p>To be a complete good web hosting company, it must have support department which works 24/7 to deal with and
          solve the problems of customers. E mail is also another great source to run customer support system, as it is
          easier to troubleshoot the system by having written details. Some low cost reliable web hosting firms also
          provide live chat with their people of customer support so that it is more convenient for clients to explain
          their problems. Security is another great issue to deal with for all web hosting companies, so there must be
          great standards of security to prevent any kind of hacking or spam and viruses. You can avail all these
          facilities from any good low cost web hosting service.</p>
        <p>If you are going for business online then you should never opt for free web hosting instead you must go for
          low cost hosting. Many times people underestimate the facilities and services of cheap low cost web hosting
          actually there is nothing wrong with the companies who are offering low cost web hosting service. One can have
          great packages from these web hosting companies, but the key point is to choose the right one to work with.
          There are some key points one must keep in mind while choosing low cost web site hosting.</p>
        <p>The first thing you must look for is the reliability of the company, no matter its low cost or highly paid,
          reliability of the company is the main issue of concern, the more reliable your host is the better your site
          will run. Second thing to look forward to with deep concern is the support provided by the web hosting
          company. You must check the system and means of their support as if they are dealing through e mail, via phone
          or by means of online support agents. As through these means you can quickly register your problem and
          ultimately get the solution in quick time. This factor is of great importance for your business too as if the
          web site is down for too long it will have very worse effects on your business. If it is back again on inter
          net in shorter time after malfunctioning, then it goes to your advantage in big time, as customers or viewers
          will be able to view your website again. So it is very important to find the company with great customer
          support system.</p>
        <p>Another important aspect to look forward to, is the availability of backup of your data. Ask your web hosting
          company about this service, whether they are taking the backup of your data or not. In case they are not
          providing the service then you must take backup of your data by your self in regular intervals, so that there
          is no loss of data in case of some damage or breakdown.</p>
        <p>Another important aspect to have information about is the up gradation packages of the company. If you want
          to up grade your package of hosting before your first deal comes to an end, then will they allow it? Also what
          will be the procedure of that sort of upgrades? These kind of hosting plans are called scalable hosting plans.
          The procedure of up gradation offered by the company must be easy and simple to handle and must not take too
          much time for its implementation. As it is not easy to switch your data from one hosting company to another so
          it is advisable to consult the company before making a deal with them, about their up gradation plans.</p>
        <p>Last but not the least thing to look for in your low cost web hosting services is the control of your
          account. You must have the total or maximum control to your account because then you can make any necessary
          changes at any time you require. But not all low cost website hosting companies provide this kind of total
          control. So if you are able to grab over all good package in good cost then this issue can be compromised to
          some extent.</p>
